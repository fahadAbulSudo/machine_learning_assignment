Fstring Is Very Helpful In Printing Txt1 = "my Name Is {fname}, I'm {age}".format(fname = "john", Age = 36) This Is Same As F-string (abbreviation Of F Is Foremat) Use Of 'in' Keyword To Find Any Radical Of Variable We Just Do Like This Num(this Is Variable) Num **.5 So Here We Get Square Root. Map Function: Lamda Function Returns Another Function __cause__ Is The Cause Of The Exception - Due To The Given Exception, The Current Exception Was Raised. This Is A Direct Link - X Threw This Exception, Therefore Y Has To Throw This Exception. __context__ On The Other Hand Means That The Current Exception Was Raised While Trying To Handle Another Exception, And Defines The Exception That Was Being Handled At The Time This One Was Raised. This Is So That You Don't Lose The Fact That The Other Exceptions Happened (and Hence Were At This Code To Throw The Exception) - The Context. X Threw This Exception, While Handling It, Y Was Also Thrown. __traceback__ Shows You The Stack - The Various Levels Of Functions That Have Been Followed To Get To The Current Line Of Code. This Allows You To Pinpoint What Caused The Exception. It Is Likely To Be Used (potentially In Tandem With __context__) To Find What Caused A Given Bug. ## Difference Between Package And Directory An Interesting Consequence Of The Package Specification Mechanism Is That Files That Are Part Of The Same Package Can Exist In Different Directories. The Package Name Is The Same For Each Class, But The Path To Each File Might Start From A Different Directory In The Class Path Imp Note: {{we Can Do Typecasting Using Map. In The Following Example, We Construct 4x3 Matrix From The User Input: For _ In Range(4): Arr.append(list(map(int, Input().rstrip().split()))) Print(arr) With An Input From The User: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 We Get A 4x3 Integer Array: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]}} Chapter 0 - Introduction: 15:13:00 Chapter 1 - Modules, Comments & Pip: 14:17:05 Chapter 1 - Practice Set: 33:10:02 Chapter 2 - Variables & Datatypes: 44:35:25 Chapter 2 - Practice Set: 01:25:10 Chapter 3 - Strings: 01:39:10 Chapter 3 - Practice Set: 02:16:56 Chapter 4 - Lists & Tuples: 02:35:04 Chapter 4 - Practice Set: 03:07:10 Chapter 5 - Dictionary & Sets: 03:20:12 Chapter 5 - Practice Set: 03:57:25 Chapter 6 - Condtional Expressions: 04:19:21 Chapter 6 - Practice Set: 04:48:53 Chapter 7 - Loops In Python: 05:14:34 Chapter 7 - Practice Set: 05:45:11 Chapter 8 - Functions & Recursion: 07:07:35 Chapter 8 - Practice Set: 06:36:28 Project 1 - Snake, Water, Gun Game: 06:52:30 Chapter 9 - File I/o: 07:06:55 Chapter 9 - Practice Set: 07:28:11 Chapter 10 - Object Oriented Programming: 08:08:38 Chapter 10 - Practice Set: 09:17:22 Chapter 11 - Inheritance: 09:48:30 Chapter 11 - Practice Set: 10:55:24 Project 2 - The Perfect Guess 11:37:01 Chapter 12 - Advanced Python 1: 11:51:21 Chapter 12 - Practice Set: 12:46:21 Chapter 13 - Advanced Python 2: 13:05:02 Chapter 13 - Practice Set: 14:00:58 Project 3 - Library Management System: 14:27:38: 13:05:02
