As we train the model and adjust the weights of `layer1` and `layer2`, we can now capture non-linear relationships between the images and their labels. In other words, introducing non-linearity makes the model more powerful and versatile. Also, since `hidden_size` does not depend on the dimensions of the inputs or outputs, we vary it to increase the number of parameters within the model. We can also introduce new hidden layers and apply the same non-linear activation after each hidden layer.\n\nThe model we just created is called a neural network. A _deep neural network_ is simply a neural network with one or more hidden layers. In fact, the [Universal Approximation Theorem](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html) states that a sufficiently large & deep neural network can compute any arbitrary function i.e. it can _learn_ rich and complex non-linear relationships between inputs and targets. Here are some examples:\n\n* Identifying if an image contains a cat or a dog (or [something else](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-the-imagenet-large-scale-visual-recognition-challenge-ilsvrc/))\n* Identifying the genre of a song using a 10-second sample\n* Classifying movie reviews as positive or negative based on their content\n* Navigating self-driving cars using a video feed of the road\n* Translating sentences from English to French (and hundreds of other languages)\n* Converting a speech recording to text and vice versa\n* And many more...\n\nIt's hard to imagine how the simple process of multiplying inputs with randomly initialized matrices, applying non-linear activations, and adjusting weights repeatedly using gradient descent can yield such astounding results. Deep learning models often contain millions of parameters, which can together capture far more complex relationships than the human brain can comprehend.\n\nIf we hadn't included a non-linear activation between the two linear layers, the final relationship between inputs and outputs would still be linear.

As discussed above, we'll create a neural network with one hidden layer. Here's what that means:\n\n* Instead of using a single `nn.Linear` object to transform a batch of inputs (pixel intensities) into outputs (class probabilities), we'll use two `nn.Linear` objects. Each of these is called a _layer_ in the network. \n\n* The first layer (also known as the hidden layer) will transform the input matrix of shape `batch_size x 784` into an intermediate output matrix of shape `batch_size x hidden_size`. The parameter `hidden_size` can be configured manually (e.g., 32 or 64).\n\n* We'll then apply a non-linear *activation function* to the intermediate outputs. The activation function transforms individual elements of the matrix.\n\n* The result of the activation function, which is also of size `batch_size x hidden_size`, is passed into the second layer (also known as the output layer).  The second layer transforms it into a matrix of size `batch_size x 10`. We can use this output to compute the loss and adjust weights using gradient descent.\n\n\nAs discussed above, our model will contain one hidden layer.
