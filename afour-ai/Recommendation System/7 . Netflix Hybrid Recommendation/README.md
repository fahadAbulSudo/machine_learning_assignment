**Description**<br>
In this project, we are creating hybrid recommendation system by combining collabortive based and content based<br>
movie recommendation system.<br>
Collaborative based system deals with recommending movies depending upon ratings data, which is consist of a table, where<br>
rows and column represents users and movies respectively, and the entry to the data is the rating given by the user to the movie<br>
In content based, we use the features of the movie like name, genree, director, actors, etc, to find the similar movies<br>
to recommend.
