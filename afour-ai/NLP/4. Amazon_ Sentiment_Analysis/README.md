The dataset is huge so from dataset try o fetch data and bifurcate them in form of negative and positive review.
After that I preprocessed the dataset so that I got the dataset in form of proper csv file. 
I applied three methods:
    1. Machine learning Naive_bayes method.
    2. LSTM model-Deep learning model.
    3. And last is BERT which is google pretrained model.
I also made a streamlit project.
